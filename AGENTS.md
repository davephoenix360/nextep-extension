# Repository Guidelines

- Provide JSDoc-style comments for all exported functions and complex helpers so future contributors understand intent quickly.
- Prefer descriptive inline comments within tricky logic (like DOM heuristics or autofill behaviors).
- When adding new user profile fields, ensure the popup and options UIs remain in sync with storage types.
